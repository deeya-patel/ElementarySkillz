Access: To access this project, run the project in Visual Studio Code and a window will open for user interaction.
Current Design: The targeted audience is early elementary school students. This HackRU Spring 2023 Project was designed to encourage users to practice simple math equations and learn the alphabet.
Targeted Design: This is my first project with very limited experience coding in Java, but I would want to improve the UI and the speed at which questions can be submitted.
